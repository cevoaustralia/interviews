# App Deployment solutioning scenario

## Background

You are consulting for a large betting company who is wanting to produce new marketing websites.

The marketing websites are based on the Gatsby.js framework - and they are looking for a method of being able to deploy these websites.

The company uses AWS extensively and would prefer that these sites be hosted in-house on AWS.

## Requirements

### Infrastructure requirements 

*The solution*

* consider security implications of running the website; the most minimal surface area is preferred
* the website solution ideally should be as fast as possible 
* the solution should be cost effective 
* in development, there might be two or three people working on 'features'
* the website should be monitored from a third party location  

### Workflow (CI) process requirements 

* developers want to be able to branch in a codebase and push to a branch and test 
* when code is 'merged to master', it should be deployed
